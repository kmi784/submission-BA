The Ising model on a square lattice with competing nearest and next-nearest neighbor interactions is highly frustrated for $J_2\!=\!-|J_1|/2$. Further,
the nature of the low temperature behavior is recently under debate. Some authors presume no phase transition at finite temperature 
with different kinds of correlation length divergence~\cite{Kalz2008,Lee2024}. Timmons et al. suggest a glass transition, based on 
computer simulation studies with a single spin update algorithm~\cite{Timmons2018}. This thesis examines the mentioned presumptions by 
studying the specific heat and the spin autocorrelations with an alternative simulation algorithm. The studies of the specific heat with the 
alternative algorithm support an exponential divergence of the correlation length at zero temperature.  A glassy behavior could be observed with 
the single spin update as well. However, it collapses for the alternative update algorithm and is perhaps a dynamic effect.
